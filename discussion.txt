We found out the following from our results: Our model has low predictive accuracy (43-59% depending on 
parameters), low time complexity (very fast execution time) and low training cost (computationally 
inexpensive). We consider our predictive power to be very low and for this reason we cant recommend such a 
system for this classification problem. However, considering we only had 4601 rows of data, we can see how a 
larger data set might lend us greater prediction power. Also, preprocessing greatly affects the accuracy of the 
algorithm. For our tests we saw accuracies from 43 % (few bins with uniform) to 59% (10 bins with uniform). If 
we had tuned this value more and experimented with different techniques we might have seen an even greater 
performance upgrade. Considering the current landscape for classification models, we tend to see accuracies 
over 90% on average with modern supervised machine learning models[x]. Therefore, in respect to modern 
algorithms, the concept learner is obsolete.
